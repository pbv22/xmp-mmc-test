	<name>XML-Maven-Plugin-Multi-Module-Catalog-Test: XML Catalog</name>
	<description>An XML catalog that makes fabricated (non-existing, pseudo-)
		URLs starting with http://example.com/schema/... for schema-a.xsd and
		schema-b.xsd resolvable to local files. The local copies of the schemas
		need to be created in the target directory using the
		maven-dependency-plugin and the catalog file must be placed next to the
		schemas using the same mechanism.</description>
